# flask_jinja2
My example for web developing, trying the combination of Flask、Jinja2、MySql and front end design with Adobe XD.

First I design these 3 pages in Adobe XD, then export them as html files and edit the form/input part manually.

I use MySql and its sample db "world", to use SQLAlchemy, each table in the database needs a mapping class defined in the python 
program.

The folder structure has to be as following:
D.flask
│  sqlapp.py
│
├─static
│  └─images
│          aaron-burden-b9drVB7xIOI-unspl.png
│          mona-eendra-vC8wj_Kphak-unspla.png
│          olivia-hutcherson-rN3m7aTH3io-.png
│
└─templates
        home.html
        home1.html
        overlay.html
